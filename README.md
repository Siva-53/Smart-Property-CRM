Project Phases
Phase 1: Problem Understanding and Industry Analysis

Mapped existing manual workflows to discover pain points like data duplication and delayed follow-ups. Benchmarked against industry standards showing automation improves conversion by 30 to 40 percent. Explored Salesforce AppExchange for property management and notification apps.

Selected Salesforce Enterprise Edition for advanced automation and API capabilities. Configured company profile, fiscal year, working hours, and holidays. Created user profiles and roles for Sales Agents, Property Managers, and Managers. Set organization-wide defaults as private for Leads and Opportunities with regional sharing rules. Used Developer Sandbox for testing and deployed changes using Change Sets.

Phase 3: Data Modeling and Relationships
Used standard objects such as Leads, Contacts, and Opportunities. Created custom objects like Property, Visit, and Deal. Added fields for property location, area, booking amount, and negotiation stage. Implemented Master-Detail and Lookup relationships. Visualized schema using Schema Builder.

Phase 4: Process Automation (Admin)
Added validation rules, such as booking amount greater than zero. Workflow rules triggered emails upon lead qualification. Process Builder automated lead assignment by region. Approval process implemented for deal closure verification. Built flow automations for visit scheduling and feedback collection. Configured automated email and SMS alerts for customers and in-app notifications for agents.

Phase 5: Apex Programming (Developer)

Used SOQL and collections for efficient data handling. Implemented Batch Apex, Queueable Apex, and Scheduled Apex for archiving and reporting. Achieved over 85 percent test coverage with structured test classes.

Phase 6: User Interface Development
Built a custom Lightning App called Smart Property Portal. Configured record pages for Properties, Visits, and Deals. Added custom tabs, a home page dashboard, and a utility bar.
